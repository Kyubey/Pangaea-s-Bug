    "summary": "Welcome to the world of bugs! If you are a little girl, then this is not the theme for you! With a venomous black widow, a cockroach that can kill, a snail that can inspect, and an annoying fly, these bugs are surely ready to battle it out in the bug world! And if that wasn't enough, even a few of the birds are getting in on the action! But in the end, there can only be one winner. Who will be able to dominate the bug world and take control? | UPDATES: Tips being added soon, I've just been very busy lately. Changed up the summary and fixed some typos in the theme, and a few other balance fixes, too. (I should probably update the /changelog more often.) If I missed anything, feel free to PM me (Pangaea) and let me know. |  Thread: http://pokemon-online.eu/threads/bugs.26630/",
